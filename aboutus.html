                    Hi my name is Sanai Farose!
                    <br>
                    I'm in the 10th grade.
                    <br>
                    I go to Fayette County High school. 
                    <br>
                    In my free time I braid hair, I'm joing an organization called HOSA(Health Occupation Students of America), and draw. 
                    <br>

                    <br>
                
                <p class="bio">
                    My name is Malik Biggs Glass and I'm 5'11, I play football, baseball, and basketball so you guys should know I'm true to this not new to this.
                    <br>
                    I got the nickname "Biggs" from Avery Ms. Kendra's son he started introducing me to people as "Biggs" at first I didn't like it but now I love it. 
                    <br>
                    I started playing sports at the age of 4. I started with baseball and football. I didn't pick up a basketball until I was in the 6th grade. 
                    <br>
                    I'm in the 9th grade at Westlake I'm on the varsity football team for them and I'm going to try out for baseball at Westlake. 
                    <br>
                    Football was always a sport where I could just be me and Let all the energy out so my family doesnâ€™t get annoyed.
                    <br>
                    Baseball has always been the sport I could be the hype man on the team so when we were hot at a certain part of the game I would be very loud and energetic and even if we were starting slow I 
                    <br>
                    would be hyped and I could have made a great play at first base at the start of the game and that would carry my energy for the rest of the game.
                    <br>
                    My position for football is Defensive tackle and my position for baseball is first base pitcher and right field and left field.
                    <br>
                    Basketball was the sport I wasn't the best but I would use my body to bully people in the paint the only thing wrong with my basketball game is that I shoot can't shoot free throws to save my life.
                    <br>
